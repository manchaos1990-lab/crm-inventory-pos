# TODO: Fix Database Path Issue in POS-Inventory Service

## Current Status
- Issue: Cross-platform database path incompatibility in WSL environment
- Service crashes due to invalid path resolution for SQLite database

## Tasks
- [x] Update server.js to use robust path handling with fs.mkdirSync for directory creation
- [x] Add error handling around database connection
- [x] Test server startup in WSL environment
- [x] Verify health endpoint accessibility
- [x] Confirm database tables are created successfully
- [x] Test in Docker as alternative (if local issues persist) - Docker not available on system, local fixes applied successfully

## Notes
- Use path.resolve for absolute paths
- Ensure ./db directory exists in development mode
- Remove manual path separator replacement (handled by path.join)
- Add detailed logging for debugging
